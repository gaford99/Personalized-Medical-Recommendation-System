# **Description**

This project is a Personalized Medical Recommendation System developed using machine learning techniques to empower users in managing their health. By inputting symptoms, users can receive accurate predictions for potential diseases, making healthcare more accessible and tailored to individual needs. This project highlights my skills in both machine learning and healthcare technology, demonstrating my ability to create impactful, user-centered solutions.

The system includes:

Symptom-based disease prediction using various machine learning models.

A recommendation module that provides tailored health advice, including potential medications, precautions, workouts, and diets.

## **Project Overview**

Data Preparation: The dataset was split into training and testing subsets to effectively train and evaluate model performance.

Training Models: The project utilizes top machine learning models including:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Naive Bayes Classifier (MultinomialNB)

Single Prediction: After training, the best-performing model is used to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms.

Recommendation System: Depending on the predicted disease, the system recommends relevant medical advice, including medications, precautions, suggested diets, and workout routines.

## **Features**

Symptom Input: Users can input symptoms to receive a possible diagnosis.

Top Model Training: The notebook compares multiple machine learning models and selects the most accurate one for disease prediction.

Customized Recommendations: Provides personalized health recommendations tailored to the user's predicted condition.

## **Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language.

Scikit-Learn: For implementing and training machine learning models.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.

Jupyter Notebook: For developing the project in an interactive environment.

## **How to Use**

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run through the cells to train the models and perform predictions.

## **Future Improvements**

Enhance the user interface for more accessible usage, possibly using a web-based application (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).

Include more sophisticated recommendation logic for tailored medical advice.

Integrate additional data sources to improve prediction accuracy.

# **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in personalized healthcare. By combining effective model training and symptom analysis, the system provides accurate disease predictions and relevant medical advice, paving the way for more accessible healthcare technologies.
